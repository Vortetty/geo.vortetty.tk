# geo.vortetty.tk
Hosts the code for my geocaching portion of my website, where you can go to find where my stamped dog tags have gone to, along with pictures of them over their travels if they are provided to me

## Why?
i didnt want to spend money on the professional tags so i just went and bought 24 tags, and gave each one a unique id! Do you want to make your own tag? Feel free to make an issue so i can give you a simple template engraving, as well as the code to use. Realistically they can be anything you want (if you can engrave or stamp it and it will be durable that is)! It is literally just free, open source, [Geocoins](https://shop.geocaching.com/default/trackable-items/geocoins), trackable through my website, and hosted on github so traffic should be no issue!
